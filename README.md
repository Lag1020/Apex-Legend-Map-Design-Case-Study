Introduction

Apex Legends is a 3D FPS game, where players can choose from different characters (or Legends) with their own unique abilities. The design of the guns and the Legends' outfits can be costumized, although that's not what I want to talk about here. What I want to talk about is the maps in which players can traverse, find loot, and combat other teams. While Apex Legends has a variety of maps, the one I want to set my eyes on is World's Edge.

Theme and Tone

World's Edge is broken up into three main sections, from what I can tell. The first one is located at the top of the map: A field of ice and snow with hints of a broken city and a stream of lava. The second one is at the opposite side of the map: A volcanic like terrain filled with pools and streams of lava. The last section is what I call the "in-between", areas that seem normal enough, with plains, mountains, cliffs, grass, and some buildings. These contrasting themes of the sections create a chaotic feeling to the map, with a hint of sorrow and ruin, as players wonder what happened to the people that the civilization's remains used to house. Along with the chaotic theming, this gives the developers a reason to create chaotic landscapes and terrain for chaotic gameplay. The map itself reflects this by not being too symmetrical, making the map consistently interesting to play on.

Scaling and Gameplay

This map is HUGE. It has to be huge to house all the interesting components of the map, although many of the maps are big in general. At the beginning of the game, when the players are choosing where to drop off, the map may not seem all that big, but once the player lands, everything that the player was able to glance at had suddenly became larger. The building themselves turn into labyrinths. However, Apex Legends, just like any other FPS games, has a mechanic that forces each team to find eachother and interact. This mechanic is the ring that damage any player that passes its boundaries. The ring, a circular boundry, progressively closes up throughout the match, forcing the players to move closer to its center. However, at the beginning of the match, each player has enough time and space to find loot that aids them to victory. Loots can be found in care packages and boxes scattered throughout the map, or they can be drops from defeating other players that they were carrying themselves.

Obstacles and Terrain

World's Edge houses some of the game's most interesting obstacles. Besides other teams, players have to keep in mind their surroundings and how to traverse them. World's Edge's lava pools deal constant damage to the player that touches them. Some pools may be small, some pools are as big as some of its landmarks, and cannot be passed through with a single jump. Luckily, the map is littered with pathways and traveling options that the player can use to avoid these obstacles. This includes ziplines, bridges, or lifts connected to the other side of the cliffs. Lava pools aren't the only components that this map has, however, as it also contains a variety of buildings and mountains that elevates them. Buildings are made up of verticality that can house muiltiple players within the same areas. By this, I mean that the buildings have floors, where can go to find loot or fight other players. These different floors can create a hectic gameplay, as players jump through each floor, trying to fight other teams or catch them off guard. The cliffs and mountains are practically the same, as for the other structures. They vary in heights and landscape that serves the same porpuse. They can act as an advantage or disadvantage to the players, although, rugged and elevated areas are generally better than open and lower areas when confronting other teams. These structures also house plenty of cover and paths that the players can take. Covers can act as shields or hiding spots that block out an opposing team's sights on the player. Paths act as different enterances and exits to sections or structures of the map, allowing players to plan out how they can interact with other teams. Besides this, the flow of the map consists of many 8 Figure shapes, with the occasional circle around landmarks or buildings.

Landmarks

Due to it's contrasting and recognizable sections, as well as the landmarks, players are able to learn about the map quicker than the other maps on the game. As I mentioned earlier, there are three main sections, all distinct from eachother. In between each of these sections, there are buildings, such as the factory, the city, and the station, along with landmarks like The Trial and The Epicenter. After playing a few matches, a player will be able to recognize these landmarks and the paths that lead to other sections. If not, there is at least a map that shows these landmarks, the ring and its nearest boundry edge.

Conclusion

I think what makes this map memorable is its recognizability and its interesting landmarks that offer unique gameplay experiences, along with the unique mechanics that the other maps don't offer. The way that all these components mix in this map support the gameplay, allowing different forms of play to shine.
